# RoarBike Landing Page

RoarBike is a modern and responsive landing page and store for a fictional bike shop developed by me. UI was inspired by a project found on behance.com.

## Live Demo

## Tools

- React
- Context-API
- CSS Modules
- SASS
- Hooks
- Custom Hooks

## What I learned?

### CSS Modules

This is my first application using CSS Modules. Using this tool allowed me to manage modules more effectively and avoid name collisions thanks to the local scope of the module. Combining CSS modules with SASS allowed me to quickly style the application and not duplicate the same code in different places

### Hooks

In addition to the basic hooks such as useState () and useEffect () in the application, I used the useContext() hook to manage the state of Modal and useReducer(), which in the first version of the application was used to handle forms. Using hooks allowed me to understand them deeper.

### Custom Hook

The first hook is called useModal and is used to manage a Modal created using React Portals. The second hook, useForm (), is used to handle forms.
Creating your own hooks allowed me not only to better understand how hooks work but also to see the situations in which they can be used.
